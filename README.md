### Hi There

I'm Daniel Bailey, a tech enthusiast currently enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp to broaden my depth of knowledge and truly relate to the engineers I talk to on a daily basis. I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, and JS to develop my first official website for my fathers book (Setting a real world project is a game changer for learning how to apply the things you pick-up in these online courses!).
